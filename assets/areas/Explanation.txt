Blue is a tunnel to the next area, green is intial point, yellow is item pickup, red is ray gun at the end.

Area 1 guide: start at the start point and go left, come to the pickup which is boots with double jump, go right to a ledge that you can double jump up, climb the tower and take the tunnel on the right to area 2.
Area 1 Secret: The area that seems blocked is actually a trick, and is instead a secret shortcut to area 3, allowing you to skip the hookshot.

Area 2 guide: coming from area 1, start a t the bottom tunnel and platform your way up the chute.  There is currently an impassable gap.  Go around the loop to get the pikcup, which is the clawshot (hookshot), you can now go from the other side of the gap and hook your way across to get to the tunnel to area 3.

Area 3 guide: coming from area 1, go up the chute and join the path coming from area 3.  go along to the left a little more and you'll find a chute, climb up and get the speed booster.  go back down and you'll run along the ground and the speed booster will allow you to get a large enough jump to get the ray gun. Pulling up a congratulations.
